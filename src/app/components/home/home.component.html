        I have created a single-page application without using traditional frameworks or librarys like Angular, React,
        or Vue.js. The application is built with HTML, SCSS, and TypeScript and compile in a Node.js environment, with
        Webpack used for compiling the project files. In this application, users can create, edit, and delete cards.
